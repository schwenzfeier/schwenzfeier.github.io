I am a data scientist working in Democratic politics, most recently as the Chief Analytics Officer on the Harris-Walz campaign. Prior to that I led Analytics at the DSCC and data science on the Biden-Harris 2020 campaign. I have also worked at BlueLabs, Hillary for America, and the Analyst Institute.

I hold a PhD in political science and an MA in statistics from Harvard University.
