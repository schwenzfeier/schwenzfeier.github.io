I am a data scientist working in Democratic politics, most recently at the DSCC. Prior to that I led the data science team on Biden for President and worked at BlueLabs, Hillary for America, and the Analyst Institute.

I am also a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University and an affiliate of the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/). My research interests include political behavior and American politics with a focus on political campaigns and public opinion. I received my BA in Government from The College of William and Mary.
