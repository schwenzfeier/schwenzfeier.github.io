I am a data scientist working in Democratic politics, most recently as the data science director at Biden for President. Prior to that, I worked on the data science team at Hillary for America and in analytics at BlueLabs and the Analyst Institute. 

I am also a PhD candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University and an affiliate of the [Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/). My research interests include political behavior and American politics with a focus on political campaigns and public opinion. I received my BA in Government from The College of William and Mary.
